# Map_DSA
ADT Map â€“ represented using a hash table with open addressing and quadratic probing.

This project implements an ADT Map data structure in C++, which uses a hash table with open addressing and quadratic probing to store key-value pairs. The project includes both short and extended tests, as well as an iterator for traversing the elements.

Files in the Project
  - App.cpp: The main application file that demonstrates the usage of the Map and tests its functionality.
  - ExtendedTest.cpp: Contains extended test cases to verify the correctness and performance of the Map data structure.
  - ExtendedTest.h: Header file for the extended test cases, defining test functions for larger and edge cases.
  - ShortTest.cpp: Contains short test cases to check basic functionality and correctness of the Map.
  - ShortTest.h: Header file for the short test cases, declaring functions to test basic operations on the Map.
  - Map.cpp: The implementation of the Map class, which uses a hash table with open addressing and quadratic probing for storage.
  - Map.h: Header file for the Map class, providing declarations for its methods and attributes.
  - MapIterator.cpp: Contains the implementation of the iterator for the Map, which allows traversing over the elements of the map.
  - MapIterator.h: Header file for the MapIterator class, defining the interface for iterating through the elements of the Map.

NOTE: The code for this project can be found on the master branch.
